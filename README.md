# Human Motion Analysis Programming
*Supervised by Prof. [Tung-Wu Lu](http://oemal.bme.ntu.edu.tw/professor/professorE.htm), Dept. of BioMedical Engineering, NTU*

Implemented MATLAB programs with a motion capture system and force plates for motion analysis, including motion tracking, evaluation of body balance, and derivation of joint forces and torques of the lower body.

## Setup
1. MATLAB 2015 (or newer versions)
2. [MTIMESX function](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support)(Fast Matrix Multiply with Multi-Dimensional)

## Programming Environment
Language: C# (in Visual Studio)

Operating System: Win10

## Hardware
1. Kinect for Xbox (Ver. 1414)

2. Arduino Uno ( Uploaded with the sample sketchbook "ServoFirmata" in Arduino IDE )

3. Self-made LEGO Manipulator

4. Servo Motor *4
