# Human Motion Analysis Programming
*Supervised by Prof. [Tung-Wu Lu](http://oemal.bme.ntu.edu.tw/professor/professorE.htm), Dept. of BioMedical Engineering, NTU*

Implemented MATLAB programs with a motion capture system and force plates for motion analysis, including motion tracking, evaluation of body balance, and derivation of joint forces and torques of the lower body.

## Requirements
1. MATLAB 2015 (or newer versions)
2. [MTIMESX function](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support)(Fast Matrix Multiply with Multi-Dimensional)
3. Programs are tested in Win10 & Ubuntu 16.04

## Execution Results
